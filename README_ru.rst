**Master Plan** is a product of strategic spatial planning and is a strategy with a pronounced urban planning component. Such a strategy is developed by the public authorities with the participation of various interest groups and can act either as an independent document complementary to the socio-economic development strategy, or as a comprehensive document integrating the spatial development strategy into the socio-economic development strategy. In foreign practice, digital master planning, which implies decision-making in spatial planning based on urban data, is gaining popularity within the concept of a smart city. Often, digital master planning implies the presence or creation of a digital twin of the city.
